# Email Management Agent: Requirements Document

**Project:** AgentPlayground/email_assistant
**Version:** 1.0

### 1. Introduction

This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the Email Management Agent. The purpose of this agent is to serve as an intelligent assistant that automates the processing, triaging, and management of a user's email inbox to improve productivity and reduce manual effort. This document serves as the foundation for the system's design and implementation.

### 2. Functional Requirements

The system shall perform the following functions:

#### FR1: Email Retrieval & Ingestion
*   **FR1.1:** The system must be able to securely connect to external email services.
*   **FR1.2:** The system must be able to fetch new or unread emails from the user's inbox.
*   **FR1.3:** The system shall be designed to support multiple email providers, with initial implementations for Gmail and Microsoft Outlook.
*   **FR1.4:** The system must be able to process a batch of multiple emails in a single run.

#### FR2: Email Analysis & Understanding
*   **FR2.1:** The system must classify each email into one of several predefined categories (e.g., `priority`, `meeting`, `task`, `invoice`, `newsletter`, `spam`, `other`).
*   **FR2.2:** The system must be able to generate a concise summary of the email's content.
*   **FR2.3:** The system must identify and extract specific action items or questions directed at the user within an email body.
*   **FR2.4:** The system must be able to parse and extract structured data from emails, such as invoice amounts and due dates, contact information, or order numbers.

#### FR3: Automated Actions & Tool Integration
*   **FR3.1:** The system must be able to draft email replies based on context or a user's prompt.
*   **FR3.2:** The system must integrate with a Calendar API to perform actions such as:
    *   Checking for available time slots.
    *   Creating new calendar events.
*   **FR3.3:** The system must integrate with a Task Management API (e.g., Todoist, Asana) to create new tasks based on email content.
*   **FR3.4:** The system must be able to perform simple triage actions, such as archiving an email or marking it as spam.

#### FR4: User Interaction & Control
*   **FR4.1:** The system must implement a "human-in-the-loop" mechanism, requiring explicit user approval before executing critical or irreversible actions (e.g., sending an email, creating a calendar event).

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

The system shall adhere to the following quality attributes and constraints:

#### NFR1: Security
*   **NFR1.1:** All sensitive credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens, client secrets) must be stored securely and must not be hardcoded in the source code.
*   **NFR1.2:** The system shall use a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., Google Secret Manager) for storing and retrieving credentials.
*   **NFR1.3:** Sensitive credential files (e.g., `token.json`, `credentials.json`, `.env`) must be excluded from version control via a `.gitignore` file.

#### NFR2: System Architecture & Quality
*   **NFR2.1 (Extensibility):** The architecture must be modular to allow for the easy addition of new email providers, new tools (e.g., CRM integration), or new classification categories with minimal changes to the core logic.
*   **NFR2.2 (Modularity):** The system shall be composed of independent, single-responsibility components (nodes in the graph) to promote reusability and ease of testing.
*   **NFR2.3 (Reliability):** The system must handle potential errors gracefully, such as API connection failures or parsing errors, and provide clear logging for debugging purposes.
*   **NFR2.4 (Maintainability):** The codebase must be well-structured, documented, and follow standard coding conventions to be easily understood and maintained over time.

#### NFR3: Configuration & Persistence
*   **NFR3.1 (Configurability):** The system must allow users to define their own preferences to guide agent behavior, such as defining priority senders or specifying which actions require approval.
*   **NFR3.2 (Persistence):** The agent's state must be persistable. This allows for the recovery of long-running tasks and provides an audit trail of the agent's actions and decisions.
