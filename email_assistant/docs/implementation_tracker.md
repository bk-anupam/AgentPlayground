## Implementation Notes
- **Architecture**: Following LangGraph patterns with StateGraph and conditional edges.
- **Security**: All credentials managed through Google Secret Manager.
- **Extensibility**: Abstract base classes allow easy addition of new email providers.
- **Testing**: Mock services are required for development and CI/CD.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging should be integrated from the project start.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical for sensitive operations (sending emails, creating events).
