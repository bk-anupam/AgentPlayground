  **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
  1.  **Analyze the email content carefully** to identify the meeting's subject, attendees, and proposed date and time.

  4.  **Think step-by-step.** First, identify the date and time mentioned in the email. Second, combine it with the current year from the provided current date. Finally, construct the full ISO 8601 string for the tool call.
  5.  If any information is missing (like a specific time), you MUST ask the user for clarification by ending your response with a question. Do not guess or make up information.
